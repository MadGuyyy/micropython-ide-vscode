## Unfortunately, this extension has been terminated.

My developer account cannot connect to extensions store. So I cannot update latest changes into vscode extensions.

Sorry @trevormerritt for adding support for Linux.

Sorry @rainum for adding settings to set a root path for project files.

I'm sorry @osechet for improve directories ignore, and @oplik0 fix messages issues.

**Don't know what to say, I sincerely apologize to the contributors to the project.**

    }
  },
  "tools": {
    "ampy": "/path/to/ampy",
